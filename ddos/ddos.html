    <ul>
        <li>Increase bandwidth
            One of the most basic steps you can take to protect against DDoS attacks is to make your hosting
            infrastructure ‚ÄúDDoS resistant‚Äù. In essence this means that you prepare enough bandwidth to
            handle traffic spikes that may be caused by cyber-attacks.
            Please be reminded however that purchasing more bandwidth itself does not satisfy as a
            complete solution to mitigate DDoS attacks. When you increase bandwidth, it does raise the bar
            which attackers have to overcome before they can launch a successful DDoS attack, but you
            should always combine this with other mitigation tactics to completely safeguard your website.</li>
        <li>Leverage a CDN Solution:
            CDN providers offer plenty of cybersecurity features and tools to protect your website from
            hackers. They also offer free SSL certificates. What‚Äôs more, when you add your website to these
            service providers, by default it provides DDoS protection to mitigate attacks on your server
            network and application.The rationale behind this is that when you leverage a CDN network, all
            malicious requests targeting L3/L4 that aren‚Äôt accessing via port 80 and 443 will be filtered out
            automatically thanks to CDN‚Äôs port protocol.Using a CDN can balance out website traffic so that
            your capped server would not be overwhelmed. Also, CDNs spread your traffic across servers in
            different locations, making it difficult for hackers to spot your original server to launch an attack.
            In addition, with a Multi CDN solution you‚Äôll be able to make use of a large network of PoPs
            from not one, but multiple CDN providers, allowing your website to sustain DDoS attacks via an
            even larger, multi-terabit-per-second globally distributed network.</li>
        <li>Implement server-level DDoS protection
            Some web hosts include server-level DDoS mitigation tools in their offering. As this feature is
            not always offered by web hosting companies, you should check with your web host. Some
            companies include it as a free service, while others offer it as a paid add-on. It all depends on the
            provider and hosting plan.</li>
        <li>Bullet-proof your network hardware configurations
            You can prevent a DDoS attack by making a few simple hardware configuration changes.For instance, you can
            configure your firewall or router to drop incoming ICMP packets or block
            DNS responses from outside your network (by blocking UDP port 53). This will help protect
            against certain DNS and ping-based volumetric attacks.</li>
        <li>Build Redundancy Into Your Infrastructure
            To make it as hard as possible for an attacker to successfully launch a DDoS attack against your
            servers, make sure you spread them across multiple data centers with a good load balancing
            system to distribute traffic between them. If possible, these data centers should be in different
            countries, or at least in different regions of the same country.
            For this strategy to be truly effective, it‚Äôs necessary to ensure that the data centers are connected
            to different networks and that there are no obvious network bottlenecks or single points of failure
            on these networks.
            Distributing your severs geographically and topographically will make it hard for an attacker to
            successfully attack more than a portion of your servers, leaving other servers unaffected and
            capable of taking on at least some of the extra traffic that the affected servers would normally
            handle.</li>
        <li>Deploy Anti-DDoS Hardware And Software Modules
            Your servers should be protected by network firewalls and more specialized web application
            firewalls, and you should probably use load balancers as well. Many hardware vendors now
            include software protection against DDoS protocol attacks such as SYN flood attacks, for
            example, by monitoring how many incomplete connections exist and flushing them when the
            number reaches a configurable threshold value.
            Specific software modules can also be added to some web server software to provide some
            DDoS prevention functionality. For example, Apache 2.2.15 ships with a module called
            mod_reqtimeout to protect itself against application-layer attacks such as the Slow Loris attack,
            which opens connections to a web server and then holds them open for as long as possible by
            sending partial requests until the server can accept no more new connections.</li>
