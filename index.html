          <p>Cyber security is necessary to protect personal data, networks,
            and personal systems from unauthorized access and protect data from misuse. Cyber security
            consists of technologies, processes and measures that are designed to protect systems,
            networks, and data damage from cybercrimes. Effective cyber security reduces the risk of a
            successful cyberattack and protects data, organizations and individuals from the planned misuse
            of systems, networks and technologies. Every year many individuals and organizations suffer
            from cyberattacks, which include data loss, information hacks, transaction problem, and
            unauthorized access of information or data. The frequency of these attacks is increasing day by
            day and itâ€™s creating a lot of problems or threats in our life. These attacks can be extremely
            damaging to businesses as well as people. Therefore, we must know about cyberattacks and their
            preventive measures as many of us are still unaware about it. The objective of this paper is to
            create awareness of the various types of cyber-attacks and lay the foundation for their cyber
            security planning</p>

            bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. It is an attack
            meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users.</p>
